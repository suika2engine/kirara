    <h2>About Suika2 Kirara</h2>
    <p>
      Suika2 Kirara is a graphical implementation of the Suika2 Visual Novel Development Engine. This application allows developers to create Suika2Script scenario files and structures from within a cohesive environment and combines a number of Suika2 features with Suika2 Pro for Creators' export functionality. This is an early version of the application and documentation, please report any strange behaviour to the contact information noted at the bottom of this page to let us know.

    <h2>Commands and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      While Kirara does not rely on keyboard-entered commands like Suika2 scenario files, it is helpful for a user to understand what each does.
      Like Suika2, Kirara uses Suika2Script as its main scenario blocks. For more information regarding Suika2Script, please see the corresponding <a id="wiki-s2s" href="https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2/wiki/3.-Suika2Script-and-Commands">Suika2 Wiki article</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Suika2Script?</h2>
    <p>
      Suika2Script is the markup language used in the creation of Suika2 script files (often referred to as scenario files in a general sense). Being such a versatile markup, the user only needs to learn a few concepts before they are able to utilise the entire feature-set from displaying messages, images, playing sounds, music, and even building menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suika2Script is an actively developed markup, therefore it is subject to changes alongside Suika2 (and sister applications).
    </p>

    <h2>What are Commands?</h2>
    <p>
      If Suika2Script is Suika2's language, then commands are the individual words and sentences that make up that language – they may seem out of place on their own, but when paired with other commands, they are able to tell brilliant stories of varying levels of intricacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Command List</h2>
    <p>Command blocks are located on the left-hand side of the screen.</p>
