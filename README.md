  <h1>Suika2 – Kirara</h1>

<!-- Content -->

Suika2 'Kirara' is a visual-editor implementation of the [Suika2](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2) visual novel development engine that
incorporates the export functionality of _Suika2 Pro for Creators_; another way of thinking is that Kirara is a Suika2 GUI wrapper.

## What can Kirara do at the moment?

Kirara is currently in its first Alpha version, this means functionality is limited, but development is ongoing.

Kirara can...
* Facilitate simple, timeline-based scenario editing.
* Facilitate graphical Suika2Script editing for all currently supported commands.*

## What can't Kirara do at the moment?

Kirara can't...
* Facilitate graphical GUI definition editing.
  * A `GUI Library` is planned as an alternative.
* Facilitate visual scenario branch editing.
  * We will introduce the structured editing of branches (`@choose`, `@if` and `@goto`).
* Facilitate the use of the `multilingual prefix` feature.
  * This feature is currently under consideration.

## What does 'Kirara' mean?

'Kirara' means 'sparkling' in Japanese.
We gave Kirara its name in the hopes that its users may create stories that themselves sparkle.

## Notes

* Deprecated commands are not supported.
